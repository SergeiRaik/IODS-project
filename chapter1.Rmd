# About the project

I wanted to gain some knowledge in data analysis for quite a long time. I found this course by simply surfing through list of courses with open registration date. This is an amazing opportunity to learn basics of up to date data analysis from experts.

The textbook is very well organized and easy to learn with. However it is always not so easy to digest the information about the tools you haven't used yet.
